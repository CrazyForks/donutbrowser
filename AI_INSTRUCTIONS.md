# Instructions for AI Agents

- After your changes, instead of running specific tests or linting specific files, run "pnpm format && pnpm lint && pnpm test". It means that you first format the code, then lint it, then test it, so that no part is broken after your changes.
- Don't leave comments that don't add value
- Do not duplicate code unless you have a very good reason to do so. It is important that the same logic is not duplicated multiple times
