# Contributing to Donut Browser

Contributions are welcome and always appreciated! üç©

To begin working on an issue, simply leave a comment indicating that you're taking it on. There's no need to be officially assigned to the issue before you start.

## Before Starting

Do keep in mind before you start working on an issue / posting a PR:

- Search existing PRs related to that issue which might close them
- Confirm if other contributors are working on the same issue
- Check if the feature aligns with our roadmap and project goals

## Tips & Things to Consider

- PRs with tests are highly appreciated
- Avoid adding third party libraries, whenever possible
- Unless you are helping out by updating dependencies, you should not be uploading your lock files or updating any dependencies in your PR
- If you are unsure where to start, open a discussion and we will point you to a good first issue

## Development Setup

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js (see `.node-version` for exact version)
- pnpm package manager
- Latest Rust and Cargo toolchain
- [Tauri prerequisites guide](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

## Run Locally

After having the above dependencies installed, proceed through the following steps to setup the codebase locally:

1. **Fork the project** & [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) it locally.

2. **Create a new separate branch.**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Install nodecar dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd nodecar
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   cd ..
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm tauri dev
   ```

This will start the app for local development with live reloading.

## Code Style & Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Biome** for JavaScript/TypeScript linting and formatting
- **Clippy** for Rust linting
- **rustfmt** for Rust formatting

### Before Committing

Run these commands to ensure your code meets our standards:

```bash
# Format and lint frontend code
pnpm format:js

# Format and lint Rust code
pnpm format:rust

# Run all linting
pnpm lint
```

## Building

It is crucial to test your code before submitting a pull request. Please ensure that you can make a complete production build before you submit your code for merging.

```bash
# Build the frontend
pnpm build

# Build the backend
cd src-tauri && cargo build

# Build the Tauri application
pnpm tauri build
```

Make sure the build completes successfully without errors.

## Testing

- Always test your changes on the target platform
- Test both development and production builds
- Verify that existing functionality still works
- Add tests for new features when possible

## Pull Request Guidelines

üéâ Now that you're ready to submit your code for merging, there are some points to keep in mind:

### PR Description

- Fill your PR description template accordingly
- Have an appropriate title and description
- Include relevant screenshots for UI changes. If you can include video/gifs, it is even better.
- Reference related issues

### Linking Issues

If your PR fixes an issue, add this line **in the body** of the Pull Request description:

```text
Fixes #00000
```

If your PR is referencing an issue:

```text
Refs #00000
```
